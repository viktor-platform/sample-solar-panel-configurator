This sample app shows how to design a home PV-system and calculate its yield.

The goal of this app is to demonstrate how the VIKTOR platform can be used in the renewable energy industry, as well as
 to demonstrate how a platform like VIKTOR can leverage community supported developments to accelerate the pace of 
developments and innovation. This app was developed on top of an open-source python library (`pvlib`) that provides a 
set of functions and classes for simulating the performance of photovoltaic energy systems.
